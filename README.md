### Mohamad Hasif Azim Bin Ibrahim
Hi I'm a self taught web developer from Sungai Buloh, Malaysia. I'm currently learning Javascript development with FreeCodeCamp and participate in Frontend Mentor Challenges to help me improve my coding skills by buiding realistic projects. I also have degrees in Actuarial Science from The National University of Malaysia (UKM) so I can't wait till I get to the point where I can jump into the more interactive data visualizations and put what I'm learning to good use. But now I'm having fun learning the basics!
